    <h1>📍 about me</h1>

    <p>spent 5 years catching money launderers. taught myself SEO. never looked back.</p>

    <p>now I'm director of SEO at <a href="https://userp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">userp</a>, where I've helped companies like <a href="https://www.formhealth.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Form Health</a>, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BigCommerce</a>, <a href="https://www.chamberofcommerce.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChamberofCommerce.org</a>, <a href="https://blinkforhome.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blink</a>, and <a href="https://www.cloudbeds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloudbeds</a> grow their organic traffic – sometimes by 300%+.</p>

    <p>miami-raised, 30+ countries traveled, now settling in málaga. when I'm not staring at search console, I'm dancing salsa or building things with claude code.</p>

    <h2>the path here</h2>

    <p>started in AML compliance (2012-2017) – made employee of the year hunting fraud patterns. pivoted to SEO in 2018 at wired rhino, where I spent 6 years growing sites by 363%. led strategy at <a href="https://seeker.digital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seeker digital</a>, ran SEO for <a href="https://orcascan.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">orca scan</a> (50,000+ orgs use their barcode platform).</p>

    <h2>proof it works</h2>

    <p>chamber of commerce: 363% organic growth, +$429K site value. form health: 292% traffic jump (24K → 94K). <a href="/case-studies">more case studies →</a></p>

    <h2>side quests</h2>

    <p>built <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thepassportabuser/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the passport memorandum</a> and turned it into $20K of sponsored travel. grew travel bag experts to 2M annual impressions – that's how I learned SEO in the first place.</p>
