    <h1>💼 case studies</h1>

    <p>real results from engagements I've led. numbers are year-over-year unless noted.</p>

    <h2>onboard</h2>
    <p><em>HR onboarding SaaS · 2.8+ years (ongoing)</em></p>

    <p>our longest client relationship. started when they had decent domain authority but were invisible for their core terms. now they're showing up in Google AI Overviews.</p>

    <p><strong>+337%</strong> organic traffic · <strong>+4,402</strong> page 1 keywords · <strong>+1,311</strong> top 3 rankings · <strong>+69</strong> DR</p>

    <h2>remote</h2>
    <p><em>global workforce platform · 1 year</em></p>

    <p>massive site, competitive space (HRIS, global employment). the challenge was finding angles that weren't already dominated by Deel and Oyster. some individual pages hit <strong>2,980%</strong> traffic spikes.</p>

    <p><strong>+316%</strong> organic traffic (+200K visits) · <strong>+74,334</strong> ranking keywords · <strong>+6,338</strong> page 1 · <strong>+1,695</strong> top 3</p>

    <h2>chamber of commerce</h2>
    <p><em>B2B directory · legacy site turnaround</em></p>

    <p>one of the largest business directories in the US – massive authority but underperforming. combined link building with a scaled content strategy across hundreds of business categories.</p>

    <p><strong>+363%</strong> organic traffic · <strong>+$429K</strong> estimated site value</p>
