<Layout title="page not found" currentSlug="">
  <div class="note-content">
    <h1>🔍 page not found</h1>

    <p>looks like this note doesn't exist – maybe it was moved or the link is broken.</p>

    <p>here are some places you might want to go instead:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="/">about me</a> – who I am and what I do</li>
      <li><a href="/case-studies">case studies</a> – results from client work</li>
      <li><a href="/resources">resources</a> – my information diet for AI and SEO</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt-8 text-gray-500 text-sm">or just pick a note from the sidebar →</p>
  </div>
</Layout>
